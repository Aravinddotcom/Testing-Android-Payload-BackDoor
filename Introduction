We are using Kali Linux Os. Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. 
It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security. It is used for penetration testing, reverse engineering.
In this testing is done by using msfvenom and metasploit framework.
Both msfvenom and metasploit framework are inbuilt in kali linux.

(1) Msfvenom is a command line instance of Metasploit that is used to generate and output all of the various types of shell code that are available in Metasploit.
root@kali:~# msfvenom -h

The advantages of msfvenom are:

* One single tool
* Standardized command line options
* Increased speed

(2) Android payload Software payloads allow you to distribute apps to devices. The payload sends the app information and location to the devices for installation. 

(3) MSFconsole provides a command line interface to access and work with the Metasploit Framework. 
The MSFconsole is the most commonly used interface to work with the Metasploit Framework
The Metasploit Framework is an open source penetration testing and development platform that provides exploits for a variety of applications, operating systems and platforms.
root@kali:~# msfconsole
